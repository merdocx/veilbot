# VeilBot - Revision 5 Summary

## Overview
Revision 5 represents a major milestone in the VeilBot project, introducing critical fixes, enhanced payment processing, and improved user experience. This revision addresses the Yookassa payment integration issues and implements a complete email collection system for fiscalization compliance.

## Key Changes & Improvements

### üîß Critical Bug Fixes

#### 1. Yookassa Payment Integration Fix
- **Issue**: Payment creation was failing with "invalid_credentials" and "Receipt is missing or illegal" errors

    },
    "items": [
        {
            "description": description,
            "quantity": 1.0,
            "amount": {
                "value": f"{amount_rub:.2f}",
                "currency": "RUB"
            },
            "vat_code": 1,  # No VAT
            "payment_mode": "full_prepayment",
