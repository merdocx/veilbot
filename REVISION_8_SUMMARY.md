# VeilBot Revision 8 Summary

## 🎯 Overview
**Revision 8** enhances the bot's operational stability and monitoring capabilities. This revision introduces a crucial alert system to notify administrators when the available key supply is critically low. It also includes a comprehensive check and correction of the `systemd` services to ensure both the bot and admin panel run as single, managed instances with autostart enabled.

## 📅 Version Information
- **Revision**: 8
- **Date**: June 22, 2025
- **Tag**: `revision-8`
- **Status**: ✅ Production Ready
- **Focus**: Monitoring & Stability

## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Low Key Availability Notifications
- **Admin Alerts**: The bot now automatically sends a notification to the specified admin (Telegram ID: `46701395`) when the total number of free keys across all servers drops below 6.
- **Status Updates**: A follow-up message is sent once the key count is restored to a healthy level.
- **Frequency**: The check runs every 5 minutes to ensure timely alerts.
- **Spam Prevention**: The notification is sent only once when the threshold is breached to avoid repeated alerts.

### 2. Process & Service Management
- **Single Instance Guarantee**: Verified and enforced that only one instance of the bot and the admin panel is running at any given time.
- **Systemd Integration**: Confirmed that both `veilbot.service` and `veilbot-admin.service` are correctly configured, enabled for autostart, and managed by `systemd`.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Diagnosed and resolved a persistent port conflict (`address already in use`) that was preventing the admin panel from starting. This was caused by a zombie process, which was identified and terminated.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `bot.py`:
    - Added a new background task `check_key_availability()` to monitor the number of free keys.
    - Implemented notification logic to alert the admin via a Telegram message.
    - Corrected `aiogram` keyboard creation to be compatible with the installed library version, resolving multiple linter errors.

### Systemd Services Verified
- `/etc/systemd/system/veilbot.service`: Confirmed it is `enabled` and `active`.
- `/etc/systemd/system/veilbot-admin.service`: Confirmed it is `enabled` and `active` after resolving startup issues.

## 📊 System Status

### Process Integrity
- ✅ **Bot**: A single instance is running, managed by `systemd`.
- ✅ **Admin Panel**: A single instance is running, managed by `systemd`.

### Autostart
- ✅ **Bot**: `enabled`
- ✅ **Admin Panel**: `enabled`

### Monitoring
- ✅ **Low Key Alert**: Active and will notify the admin if keys drop below 6.
